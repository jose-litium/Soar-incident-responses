# SOAR Incident Response Automation – Google Workspace & Chronicle Integration

**Author:** Jose Moreno  
**Date:** May 2025

---

## Executive Summary

This document describes a Google Workspace–centric prototype for automating security incident response (SOAR) using Apps Script, Google Docs, Gmail/Chat, and Chronicle SIEM. It supports auto-escalation, executive reporting, collaborative updates, and seamless stakeholder notifications. Real-world integration with Chronicle enables instant workflow kickoff based on custom detection rules.

## 1. Incident Response Workflow: SecOps Lead Perspective

As a SecOps Lead, I orchestrate the end-to-end response:
- **Detection & Triage**: Chronicle/EDR/IOC alerts, contextual risk analysis.
- **Automated Kickoff**: When escalation logic is met, workflow starts, incident record created.
- **Stakeholder Notification**: Auto-email/Chat to all relevant roles, with report link.
- **Collaboration**: Google Doc as the "source of truth," updated by all responders.
- **Follow-Up & Reminders**: Periodic reminders (every 3–4 hours) until closure.
- **Closure & Review**: Formal review and lessons learned recorded.

---

## 2. Workflow Triggers

- **Primary:** Chronicle SIEM (IOC, login anomalies, critical events)
- **Secondary:** EDR, DLP, manual analyst escalation
- **Logic Example:** Suspicious login + IOC match + sensitive data = automatic kickoff

---

## 3. Stakeholders and Roles

| Role                  | Responsibilities                                        |
|-----------------------|--------------------------------------------------------|
| SecOps Lead/Team      | Directs, assigns, reviews, escalates, closes           |
| On-Call Engineers     | Triage, containment, technical analysis                |
| Product Owner         | Business impact, prioritization                        |
| Management/Compliance | Closure approval, regulatory reporting                 |
| DPO                   | Data risk/legal/compliance when required               |

## 4. Collaboration: Automation vs. Manual Judgment

- **Automated:** Record generation (Doc/Sheet), notifications, reminders.
- **Manual:** Risk assessment, containment, communications, review.
- **Best practice:** Automation for speed/consistency, manual for risk and decision-making.

---

## 5. Tooling, Integrations, and Escalation Paths

- **Google Workspace**: Docs (report), Sheets (log), Gmail/Chat (notifications)
- **Chronicle SIEM**: Detection rules, webhook triggers
- **Slack/Mailjet** (optional): Real-time chat/email for high-visibility or external comms
- **Escalation:** High severity, regulated data, repeated attack, reputation/legal impact

---

## 6. Automated Communication Kickoff

- Email or Chat to stakeholders auto-generated when workflow is triggered.
- Message includes: incident title, timestamp, severity, IOCs, Google Doc link.
- *(Insert sample notification screenshot/diagram here if available)*

---

## 7. Executive Summary Generation (Bonus)

- Script or GPT API creates a one-paragraph summary for management, inserted at the top of the report.

---

## 8. Scheduled Reminders (Bonus)

- Apps Script trigger sends periodic reminders to keep team updating the incident doc/timeline.

---

## 9. Improvements & Roadmap

**Short-Term:** Cloud Logging, dashboard in Sheets  
**Mid-Term:** RBAC in Docs, BigQuery analytics, chatbots  
**Long-Term:** Direct Chronicle webhook, push/SMS, automated threat hunting
